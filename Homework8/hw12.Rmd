#### Download FiveThirtyEight Dataset

+ First, I found a dataset on FiveThirtyEight.com and downloaded it into a .csv file  

***

#### Uploading .csv file into MySQL

+ Next, I uploaded the .csv file into MySQL, utilizing this script. 

***

+ Once the file was correctly loaded into MySQL, into the 'averages' table, I was then able to read it into R by using the syntax below:  

```{r setup}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
library(RMySQL)
mydb = dbConnect(MySQL(), user='root', password='Biology512', dbname='hw12', host='localhost', port = 3306)

dbListTables(mydb)

sql_data <- dbGetQuery(mydb, "SELECT * FROM averages")
sql_data <- data.frame(sql_data)
head(sql_data, n=20L)
```

***

#### Migrating data to MongoDB

```{r}
library(mongolite)

collection_add <- mongo(collection = "hw12data", db = "hw12")

collection_add$insert(sql_data)

collection_add$count()
```

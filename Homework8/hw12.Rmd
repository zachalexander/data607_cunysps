#### Download FiveThirtyEight Dataset

+ First, I found a dataset on FiveThirtyEight.com and downloaded it into a .csv file  

***

#### Uploading .csv file into MySQL

+ Next, I uploaded the .csv file into MySQL, [utilizing this script](https://github.com/zachalexander/data607_cunysps/blob/master/Homework8/upload_data.sql).

#### Reading the MySQL data into R

+ Once the file was correctly loaded into MySQL into the 'averages' table, I was then able to read it into R using the `RMySQL` package and the syntax below:  

```{r, echo=FALSE}
password <- 'Biology512'
```


```{r setup, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(RMySQL)
library(knitr)
library(kableExtra)

# connecting to MySQL from R
mydb = dbConnect(MySQL(), user='root', password=password, dbname='hw12', host='localhost', port = 3306)

dbListTables(mydb)

sql_data <- dbGetQuery(mydb, "SELECT * FROM averages")
sql_data <- data.frame(sql_data)

kable(head(sql_data, n = 20L), align = rep('c', 5)) %>% 
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "responsive", "condensed"), full_width = TRUE)
```

#### Migrating data to MongoDB

+ Now that I had my data in a Relational database, and could read it into R, I did some research to find a package in R that would be able to connect to a NoSQL database. I decided to use the `mongolite` package and MongoDB. I've used MongoDB in the past, and it seemed like a great option for this assignment.  

+ With my 'averages' data in a dataframe in R that was pulling directly from my SQL connection, I then created a collection in my new MongoDB instance and ran it locally. In order to connect and insert the data into my new collection using `mongolite` in R, I did the following:

```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(mongolite)

# created a new collection in MongoDB
collection_add <- mongo(collection = "hw12data", db = "hw12")
```

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# inserted the data into the collection from R to MongoDB
collection_add$insert(sql_data)
```

+ After running this code, I was able to refresh the table in MongoDB, using the Studio 3T interface, and found the following:

![Table view of the data in MongoDB collection after successful migration](/Users/zdalexander/Desktop/grad_school/data_607_cunysps/data607_cunysps/Homework8/table_view.png) 

***

#### Testing the migration

+ A few quick tests to make sure the counts match between the MySQL dataset and my MongoDB collection:

```{r}
paste0('In my MySQL dataset there are ', length(sql_data$bioguide), ' observations.')
```

```{r}
paste0('In my MongoDB database collection there are ', collection_add$count(), ' observations.')
```

It appears that there was a successful migration!
